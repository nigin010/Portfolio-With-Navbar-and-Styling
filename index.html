              Hey guys! I'm Nigin. I hail from Ernakulam, Kerala, India. 
              I did my graduation from Toc H Institute of Science and Technology, Arakkunnam, Kerala, India. 
              I've been doing code from school days, and I've had passion for that ever since. 
              I have worked with various technologies including popular coding languages like C, Java, Python, Flutter etc., 
              various databases like Firebase, NoSQL, MySQL, etc., and a gaming engine that is Unity 3D. After I worked in Unity 3D, 
              I've had so much passion for game development. The main game project that I've worked on is called "Meta-Saurs - A Blockchain based Trading Game", 
              which was done as a part of the final year project during the college days. 
              The gameplay can be found by clicking <span>here</span>. My main aim is to become a game developer. 
              To talk about my teamwork, I'm extremely good in working with my team members and excel with team leading qualities.
              I look forward to work with y'all.
              Thanks!
