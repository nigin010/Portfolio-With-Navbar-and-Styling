              Hey guys! I'm Nigin. I hail from Ernakulam, Kerala, India. 
              I did my graduation from Toc H Institute of Science and Technology, Arakkunnam, Kerala, India. 
              I've been doing coding from school days, and I've had passion for that ever since. 
              I have worked with various technologies including popular coding languages like C, Java, Python, Flutter etc., 
              various databases like Firebase, NoSQL, MySQL, etc., and a gaming engine that is Unity 3D. After I worked in Unity 3D, 
              I've had so much passion for game development. The main game project that I've worked on is called "Meta-Saurs - A Blockchain based Trading Game", 
              which was done as a part of the final year project during the college days. 
              The gameplay can be found by clicking <a href = "https://youtu.be/-M-xeZxtplA"><span style = "color : orange;">here</span></a>. One of my other main project was "Contactless Smart Payment System In Public transport". My main aim is to become a game developer. 
              To talk about my teamwork, I'm extremely good in working with my team members and excel with team leading qualities.
              I look forward to work with y'all.
              Thanks!

          <h3>MetaSaurs - A Blockchain based Trading Game.</h3>

          The gaming engine used for designing the game is Unity 3D.
          Different technologies that were used for the development of the project
          includes Unity 3D, Ganache, Blockchain, Blender, NFTs and Metamask. Ganache is a 
          blockchain emulating platform used to emulating the blockchain. Metamask
          wallet was used for doing the transactions among different players. 
          Blender was used for designing many 3D objects that were used in-game. 
          The pet dinos in the game are playable assets which was also the NFT. 
          The main attraction of the project was the game playing element, blockchain and NFTs.
          The complete gameplay can be found by clicking  <a href = "https://youtu.be/-M-xeZxtplA"><span style = "color : orange;">here</span></a>.

          <h3>Contactless Smart Payment System In Public transport</h3>

          The ticketing system in most of the public transport vehicles in our country
          is based on giving money to the bus conductors in-hand. This can lead to many
          different problems like spreading of germs through money, customers not having
          the right amount of money to pay for the ticket, conductors not giving back the balance 
          amount and so on. This project mainly focuses on automating the whole ticket taking
          system in such a way that is very well practical for our country which would solve the 
          ticketing issue as well as reduce the number of conductors there by save some money of the government which is usually
          given as salary to the conductrs. The main technologies used
          includes Python, RFID Sensors, RFID Cards, OpenStreet API and Firebase for database.
